 # titanic-dataset
 
 Analyze the Titanic dataset and fit a logistic regression model to predict passenger survival. 
 In the first part, understanding the Titanic dataset and perform exploratory data analysis. 
 In Part 2,taking care of the missing values. 
 In part 3, performing further pre-processing on the dataset to handle categorical attributes, and remove highly correlated attributes. 
 Further, training a logistic regression model in part 4. 
 Finally,learn how to visualize the logistic regression model.
 using Scikit Learn in Python for the project implementation.
